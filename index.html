		<p><b>What I Do:</b>  <i>I concentrate primarily on portraiture and project-based photographic essays.</i><br><b>My Process:</b>  <i>My workflow includes many different types of photographic processes and mediums.</i></p>
		<p><b>Artist Statement:</b>  <i>â€œI strive to create traditional images on traditional media through traditional processes of non-traditional subjects and juxtapositions.  I'm not interested in the preservation of "moments" in time.  Instead, I want to explore things and visually define them.  I look for exceptional people and their stories.  I also focus on the profound things in life that make a bold statement, or represent something that runs against the grain of what is "normal"."</i></p>
